# Server Side Enterprise Data Collection Blueprint

Server Side Enterprise Data Collection Blueprint shows how data collected with Adobe Experience Platform Web and Mobile SDKs can be forwarded from Experience Platform Edge Network to a desired destination. You can forward all raw data collected from the SDKs or specific data based on events and rules as configured in tag properties (formerly Launch).

## Use Cases

* Collect data from web or mobile using a single collection tag, lightening code weight on client browsers and apps. Propagate the collected data to various endpoints for a single source of data collection.
* Forward collected data to partner applications or data storage locations for building insights and applications against the collected data.

## Applications

* Adobe Experience Platform Collection
